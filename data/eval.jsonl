{"query": "Explain the causes of the French Revolution", "positive": "The French Revolution (1789-1799) stemmed from economic crisis, social inequality under the ancien régime, Enlightenment ideas challenging absolute monarchy, and fiscal mismanagement. The bourgeoisie sought political representation while peasants suffered from feudal obligations and food shortages.", "complexity": "medium", "domain": "history", "negative": "The principal-agent problem arises when managers (agents) may not act in shareholders' (principals') best interests due to misaligned incentives and information asymmetry. Solutions include performance-based compensation, board oversight, and market disciplines. Agency costs reduce firm value through monitoring expenses and residual loss."}
{"query": "What are atoms made of?", "positive": "Atoms are composed of three main particles: protons and neutrons in the nucleus, and electrons orbiting around it.", "complexity": "easy", "domain": "science", "negative": "The Industrial Revolution transformed agrarian societies into industrial ones through mechanization and factory systems. It caused urbanization, created industrial working class, improved productivity but initially worsened working conditions, and led to significant social and economic changes including rise of capitalism."}
{"query": "Describe the impact of the Industrial Revolution on society", "positive": "The Industrial Revolution transformed agrarian societies into industrial ones through mechanization and factory systems. It caused urbanization, created industrial working class, improved productivity but initially worsened working conditions, and led to significant social and economic changes including rise of capitalism.", "complexity": "medium", "domain": "history", "negative": "WiFi uses radio waves to transmit data wirelessly between devices and routers. It operates on specific frequency bands (2.4GHz and 5GHz) and follows IEEE 802.11 standards."}
{"query": "How does the adaptive immune system recognize pathogens?", "positive": "Adaptive immunity uses T and B lymphocytes with specific antigen receptors generated through V(D)J recombination. T cells recognize peptide-MHC complexes, while B cells produce antibodies against diverse epitopes. Memory cells provide long-lasting immunity after initial exposure.", "complexity": "medium", "domain": "medicine", "negative": "Historians debate whether Rome 'fell' or transformed. Theories include barbarian invasions, economic decline, overextension, Christian influence weakening civic virtue, lead poisoning, and climate change. Modern scholarship emphasizes gradual transformation rather than sudden collapse, with regional variations in Western and Eastern empires."}
{"query": "Explain the efficient market hypothesis and its implications for investment strategy", "positive": "The efficient market hypothesis posits that asset prices reflect all available information, making it impossible to consistently achieve above-market returns. The semi-strong form suggests technical and fundamental analysis cannot beat the market. Implications include passive indexing strategies and challenges to active management fees.", "complexity": "hard", "domain": "business", "negative": "Adaptive immunity uses T and B lymphocytes with specific antigen receptors generated through V(D)J recombination. T cells recognize peptide-MHC complexes, while B cells produce antibodies against diverse epitopes. Memory cells provide long-lasting immunity after initial exposure."}
{"query": "Discuss the principal-agent problem in corporate governance", "positive": "The principal-agent problem arises when managers (agents) may not act in shareholders' (principals') best interests due to misaligned incentives and information asymmetry. Solutions include performance-based compensation, board oversight, and market disciplines. Agency costs reduce firm value through monitoring expenses and residual loss.", "complexity": "hard", "domain": "business", "negative": "Gravity is a fundamental force that attracts objects with mass toward each other. On Earth, it keeps us grounded and causes objects to fall."}
